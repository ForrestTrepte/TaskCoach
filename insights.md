# Insights

Here are a collection of examples from my task coach conversations where I considered the LLM to be *insightful*. Cases where it was particularly helpful or pointed out something I hadn't considered that helped me to become more productive.

## General helpful patterns

* Helped me by creating concrete success metrics
* Encouraged me to think about what order and when in the day best suited to particular tasks
* Naturally understood what my tasks were about--didn't need a lot of added context
* Generally, I was already on track -- it pointed out a lot of things I'm doing well psychologically. Didn't identify many any areas of improvement. Although explaining my approach to it probably encouraged me to be at my best when I might not have been as sharp otherwise.

## Insightful observations

* "That's a classic executive function challenge - waiting periods can be productivity traps! Some strategies that work well:
  - Keep a "quick wins" list for 5-10 minute gaps
  - Use waiting time for physical movement (walk, stretch)
  - Set a phone timer when you do allow YouTube ("5 minutes only")
  - Have a specific "waiting task" ready (like reviewing your task list or doing quick email)"

## Insightful questions

* "How do you feel about the balance between your "dig out personal tasks" goal and your "projects" goal right now? Are you feeling more caught up on personal tasks after your recent big completion spree, or do you still feel buried under the backlog?"
* Have you been successfully using the replacement activities (bed + reading/phone games) instead of falling into late-night YouTube spirals since we discussed those strategies?

## Interesting phenomena

* I had a task about developing the life coach process itself. The LLM realized that, based on its prompt, it must itself be the life coach. And, because it exists, it must be that I'm already working on that task.
