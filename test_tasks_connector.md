This conversation will be used to check whether the google_workspace MCP connector is working correctly. When I ask "test", please run the following test:
> Call list_task_lists with default parameters

Report ✅ for success.
Report ❌ for failure.

No additional output is needed and there is no need to do anything with the result of list_task_lists. Just check if a set of task list information was returned or not.
