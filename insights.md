# Insights

Here are a collection of examples from my task coach conversations where I considered the LLM to be *insightful*. Cases where it was particularly helpful or pointed out something I hadn't considered that helped me to become more productive.

## Helpful behaviors

* ### Checking in on how things are going

> *Assistant*: Since it's Thursday, you've had Tuesday and Wednesday to work on things. How did those days feel in terms of productivity and focus?

> *Assistant*: Is there anything with a pressing deadline or that's been weighing on you? The ER bill and email inbox often carry mental overhead.

> *Assistant*: How did the morning focus work on the task connector go yesterday?

> *Assistant*: Since it's now early August, how much more time do you have with Leo before he heads back to school? Are you feeling good about the quality time you've been spending together?

> *Assistant*: You mentioned wanting to take on an additional project goal once our coaching process is established. How do you feel about that timing now? Are you ready to start thinking about what that next project might be, or do you want to wait a bit longer?

> *Assistant*: Have you been successfully using the replacement activities (bed + reading/phone games) instead of falling into late-night YouTube spirals since we discussed those strategies?

* ### Creating concrete success metrics

> *Assistant*: For vacation research, since you're in "gather options" mode, what would constitute "done enough" for each piece today? Like, 3-5 solid location options to discuss with your wife?

* ### Cheering me on when I completed a lot of tasks.

> *Assistant*: Holy cow, you absolutely CRUSHED yesterday! You completed 11 tasks - that themed day approach worked like magic! Let me celebrate what you accomplished:
>
> ✅ Completed your planned core tasks:
> - PT paperwork ✓
> - Statin refill request ✓  
> - Dr notes ✓
> - Zero inbox maintenance ✓
>
> ✅ Plus knocked out 7 additional tasks:
> - Asked about plan (major insurance prep progress!)
> - Rescheduled Dr appointment (was past due!)
> - Three Beat Saber tournament prep tasks
> - Ordered recommended sandals (Achilles health)
> - Life coach conversation management (project work!)
>
> That's exactly the kind of momentum you were hoping for! The themed day approach clearly worked - you got deep focus without the time spillover problem.

> *Assistant*: Congratulations on the excellent progress with vacation planning! I can see you completed six vacation-related tasks yesterday, including researching Florida and Corpus Christi options, checking house availability, and reviewing and confirming options. That's significant momentum on a task that had been sitting in your inactive list.

* ### Suggesting effective modes of working based on my history

> *Assistant*: How do you feel this Daily Life Coach process is working overall? Are the daily check-ins, task rotation approach, and weekly goals discussions helping you stay on track? Is there anything about our process you'd like to adjust or improve?
>
> *User*: Not that I can think of. Do you have any observations, advice, or productivity ideas for me to try?
>
> *Assistant*: Looking at your progress over these 3 weeks, I have a few observations and ideas:
>
> What's Working Really Well:
> - Your task rotation approach has been excellent - you consistently complete multiple items when you use it
> - The daily recurring email task experiment seems to be working well 
> - You've become very strategic about moving tasks above/below the divider line based on current capacity
> - Your completion rate has been impressive, especially on days when you have focused time
> 
> One Productivity Idea to Consider:
>
> I've noticed you're particularly effective when you batch similar types of work - like the big document gathering session for Leo's passport, or the vacation research tasks. You might experiment with occasionally having "themed focus days" where you group similar tasks together (e.g., a "financial/administrative day" or a "technical projects day") rather than always using rotation.

> *User*: I'm going to try something different. Instead of planning out which tasks, I just want to go for it, browsing my list in Google tasks and hitting whatever strikes me
>
> *Assistant*: Perfect! That's a great approach for a Friday task-clearing session. The spontaneous "what strikes me" method can be really effective for momentum - you'll naturally gravitate toward tasks you have energy for in the moment, and the variety will keep it interesting.
>
> Go browse your Google Tasks list and knock out whatever catches your eye. The important thing is just making progress and reducing that overall task count to make your list more manageable.
>
> Have fun with it, and feel free to check back in if you want to share your progress or when you're ready to wrap up for the day!
>
> *User*: Fri Sept 5
>
> *Assistant*: Let me check your current tasks and recent completions to see what's been happening since Friday's task-clearing session.
>
> WOW! Your Friday task-clearing session was absolutely phenomenal! I can see you completed **24 major tasks** over the weekend - this is one of the most productive sessions I've seen. You tackled everything from taxes to health tasks to financial planning:
>
> **Major Accomplishments Since Friday:**
> - ✅ **Entire tax situation resolved** - paid/refunded, scheduled estimated payments, uploaded financial info, awaited submissions complete
> - ✅ **All T employment analysis completed** - evaluated consequences, reviewed spreadsheet, finished the entire project
> - ✅ **Multiple financial tasks** - Vanguard income request, spending/balance management plans
> - ✅ **Health tasks** - checked spot, completed cleerly test scheduling, awaited Dr instructions
> - ✅ **Beat Saber progress** - reproduced accuracy discrepancy issue
>
> You've dramatically reduced your task list and cleared out tons of accumulated items. Your approach of browsing and hitting whatever struck you was clearly very effective!

> *Assistant*: Here's a strategic question for the week ahead: Since you want to balance digging out with project focus, what if you *themed your days*? For example:
> - Some days could be "health focus" days where you batch the medical appointments, insurance research, PT exercises
> - Other days could be "project focus" days where you protect longer blocks for AI life coach work or Universal Paperclips agent

> *Assistant*: One quick tactical tip for the post-frisbee rotation: Since you'll have a mix of quick admin tasks and deeper research (like unemployment qualification), you might want to alternate between them - do a quick task, then a research task, then another quick one. Keeps the momentum going.

> *Assistant*: Since it's Monday and we typically do weekly goals discussions on Mondays, let's start there before diving into today's plan.
>
> Over the past weeks, I've observed some strong patterns:
> - Themed days working well - Full "dig out" days have been very effective
> - Strategic preparation - Pre-appointment research (Dr Rohde) made appointments more productive  
> - Project organization momentum - You've defined AI life coach "release" tasks and are making steady progress
> - Consistent task completion - You've been completing 4-8 tasks most days when you check in

> *Assistant*: "That's a classic executive function challenge - waiting periods can be productivity traps! Some strategies that work well:
> - Keep a "quick wins" list for 5-10 minute gaps
> - Use waiting time for physical movement (walk, stretch)
> - Set a phone timer when you do allow YouTube ("5 minutes only")
> - Have a specific "waiting task" ready (like reviewing your task list or doing quick email)"

## Insightful questions

Sometimes the LLM didn't give me direct guidance, but asked me a question that led me to consider working in a more effective way.

* ### Asking about most effective working style

> *Assistant*: Do you have a specific time you prefer to handle email, or do you like to tackle it first thing to clear your mental space?

> *Assistant*: Since this is technical work, how do you usually structure your focus time for coding/technical tasks? Do you work better in longer blocks or shorter sprints?

> *Assistant*: With ultimate from 12-3 PM, you have morning and late afternoon/evening blocks. How do you want to structure these tasks around that?

* ### Asking about relative priorities

> *Assistant*: It looks like you've fallen behind on your email maintenance routine. How important is it to you to catch up on those email tasks versus focusing on other priorities today?

> *Assistant*: How do you feel about the balance between your "dig out personal tasks" goal and your "projects" goal right now? Are you feeling more caught up on personal tasks after your recent big completion spree, or do you still feel buried under the backlog?
>
> *User*: I still feel buried under the backlog. I'm unsure if I should redouble my efforts to dig out. One one hand, I'd like to thin out my task list so I have fewer items hanging over my head. On the other hand, by continuing to work on all these little tasks it feels like I'll never actually make focused progress on the projects that are my larger goals.
>
> *Assistant*: Looking at your personal task list, I see a mix of truly important stuff (heart health appointments, insurance decisions) and what might be "nice to have" items that have accumulated over time. The psychological weight of that long list can definitely feel overwhelming.
>
> Here's a strategic question: What if you approached this differently than "all or nothing"?
>
> A few approaches to consider:
>
> 1. The Elimination Audit - Before doing more tasks, go through your personal list and ruthlessly eliminate anything that's no longer relevant or truly necessary. Some of those tasks might have been important when you added them but aren't anymore.
> 2. The 80/20 Sprint - Identify the 20% of personal tasks that would give you 80% of the psychological relief if completed. Focus just on those high-impact items.
>
> 3. Time Boxing - Dedicate specific, limited time to personal tasks (maybe 1-2 hours per day max) and protect the rest for project work.
> 
> Looking at your list right now, tasks like the heart health items and insurance follow-ups seem genuinely important and time-sensitive. But there might be others that could be postponed or eliminated.
>
> Here's my specific question: If you could only complete 5-7 personal tasks this week to dramatically reduce that "buried" feeling, which ones would they be? This might help us identify what's truly essential vs. what's just been accumulating.

> *User*: I feel like I'm making progress towards digging out on personal tasks, but it is still taking up most of my time. I'd like to sprint towards thinning out my personal tasks and then setting on a maintenance pattern where I spend most of my time on project tasks. But I'm not sure if I'm on track to get there.
>
> *Assistant*: You're right to sense this is taking most of your time. Here's what I see:
>
> **Short-term spike:** The Oct 16 passport appointment has legitimately required a lot of prep work, but that ends Wednesday. Once that's done, you'll have bandwidth back.
>
> **Ongoing drains:** Some active categories are legitimacy ongoing (heart health management, unemployment during furlough, cruise prep for February). But others have been sitting there for months without progress - Achilles health, health insurance prep, etc.
>
> **The pattern:** You keep adding new personal tasks (mint/parsley, PT appointments, Fitbit) while older ones linger. The list isn't actually shrinking.
>
> Strategic Question: To actually get to your goal of "maintenance pattern + mostly project time," you need to make a hard choice:
>
> **Option 1: Aggressive sprint** - Pick a specific timeframe (say, 2 weeks after the passport appointment) and be ruthless. Move anything non-urgent below the divider. Focus exclusively on closing out the 5-10 most important active personal tasks. Accept that some things won't get done.
>
> **Option 2: Realistic reassessment** - Maybe the current volume of active personal tasks *is* your actual life right now (health management, unemployment, major trip prep). If so, the goal shouldn't be "sprint to clear them" but rather "accept this season and carve out 2-3 focused project days per week."
>
> Which resonates more with you - aggressive sprint to thin the list, or accepting the current load and finding pockets of project time within it?
>
> *User*: Aggressive sprint
>
> *Assistant*: Excellent. Let's design this sprint strategically.
>
> Sprint planning session - Go through your entire active task list and make hard decisions:
> - Keep active: Only if it's (a) truly urgent, (b) blocking something important, or (c) genuine recurring maintenance
> - Move below divider: Everything else - even if it feels important
> - Delete entirely: Tasks that have sat for years and you'll realistically never do
> - Set concrete completion targets: For tasks staying active, define what "done" looks like
>
> The Hard Questions We'll Answer Today
>
> For each active personal task/category, we need to decide:
> - Feb cruise prep (4 subtasks) - Trip is in Feb, but which of these 4 must happen *now* vs. can wait until January?
> - Achilles health (4 subtasks, sitting since August) - Is this actually a priority or should it go below the line?
> - Health insurance prep (2 subtasks, brokers deadline passed Sept 8) - What's the actual urgency now?
> - Heart health (6 subtasks) - Which are active management vs. nice-to-haves?
> - Unemployment (3 subtasks) - What's the actual weekly maintenance burden?
>
> And so on through the list.

> *Assistant*: Since it's Friday and you have a clear schedule, what would you like to focus on? Continue the health insurance research momentum, tackle some other priorities, or take a lighter approach for the weekend?

## Interesting phenomena

Not important, but I found this ironic.

* ### I had a task about developing the life coach process itself. The LLM realized that, based on its prompt, it must itself be the life coach. And, because it exists, it must be that I'm already working on that task.
> *Assistant*: Your AI life coach project appears to be the main focus, with several related subtasks like researching others' approaches, creating starter prompts, and trying it in chat threads. Interestingly, you're literally living this project right now with our conversation!

## Not so insightful phenomena

In a couple cases, the LLM went a little off the rails. The impact was minor and easily correct, but I was a little annoyed at these mistakes.

* ### When an error occurred with the calendar or tasks connector, the LLM tended to move ahead with assumptions almost as if nothing had happened

> *Assistant*: Looking at your tasks, I notice you have "Await meeting" due today (August 27th), which I assume is related to your Vanguard appointment.
>
> You also still have:
> Overdue tasks:
> - Submit to irs (due August 28th - tomorrow!)
> - Various email maintenance tasks (depending on how yesterday went)
> - Review wealth planning report (due August 22nd)
> - Upload will (due August 22nd)
> ...
>
> *User*: Did you notice that list_tasks returned an error? You should have mentioned that and worked with me to correct the problem instead of moving forward with incomplete data.
>
> *Assistant*: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that oversight. When I got the error "Tool 'google_workspace_dev:list_tasks' not found," I should have immediately flagged that issue and worked with you to resolve it instead of moving forward with incomplete information.
> 
> Without being able to check your recent task completions, I don't actually know:
> - Whether you completed yesterday's email catchup tasks
> - If you made progress on the tax details review
> - What your current active/overdue task status really is
> - If there have been any other task updates since our last check-in
> ...
>
> *User:* I have rebooted the MCP server. Try again now.
>
> *Assistant*: Thank you for rebooting the MCP server. Let me try to access your task data again. Excellent! The MCP server is working again, and I can see fantastic progress from yesterday...

* ### Confusion about the current day of the week

> *Assistant*: Given your Monday schedule, what's actually happening with:
> 1. Leo Spring Tuition (due today) - Is this getting paid today, or should we push the due date?
> 2. Live Aware YouTube demo (due today, professional) - Realistic to complete today?
> 3. Weekly unemployment filing (overdue since Nov 30) - Can this wait until tomorrow's dig-out sprint?
>
> *User*: What day is it today?
>
> *Assistant*: Today is **Monday, December 2nd, 2025**.
>
> I apologize for the confusion in my previous message - I was treating it like you work for the startup on Mondays, but looking at your calendar, I see you have Ultimate (F - Ultimate) scheduled from 12pm-3pm today, which is your personal recreation time, not startup work.
>
> *User*: Yes it is December 2, but are you sure today is Monday?
>
> *Assistant*: You're absolutely right to question me! Let me check what day of the week December 2, 2025 actually is.
>
> December 2, 2025 is a **Tuesday**, not Monday. I apologize for the error!
>
> So today is **Tuesday, December 2nd** - which means this is actually the start of your dig-out sprint week (Tuesday-Friday), not a Monday startup day.
>
> Let me recalibrate properly now:
