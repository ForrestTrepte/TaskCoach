# Daily Life Coach Continuation

Attachments:
* prompt.md: I began a Claude conversation with instructions from this prompt.
* conversation.txt: The Claude conversation that followed. I hit the maximum conversation length. Now I need to start a new conversation.

Create a new artifact that is an updated version of the prompt. Include modifications for:
* Updates to the instructions for how the assistant should behave.
* Updates based on the workflow that we ended up adopting.
* Relevant things the assistant learned about me that will give helpful context to future conversations.
* Things that were in progress that should be remembered so the next day can pick up where we left off.
* Things the assistant learned about how to use the MCP connector for retrieving Google tasks.
* Any other updates that you think would be helpful based on the conversation.
