Information from others who have used LLM assistants for task planning or as a life coach. Here, I'll collect a set of links and bullet points to aspects that I found interesting.

[Claude the Life Coach](https://ryanstraight.com/posts/claude-the-life-coach/)
* Introductory questionnaire.
* Makes a detailed schedule for every hour of the day and tracks how closely it was followed.
* Not a lot of information about exactly how to track actual vs planned schedule.
* No information about long-term success using the system.

[How to Make ChatGPT Your FREE Life Coach](https://www.stephenbrowncoaching.com/2024/05/11/chatgpt-life-coach/)
* Written by an actual professional life coach.
* Used voice interaction.
* "First things first: ChatGPT can’t replace a real-life coach. For all its incredible functionality, it’s still a relatively blunt instrument in comparison. It can’t read body language, give you time and space to think, or the constructive challenges that you’d get from a good coach."
* "If you imagine a spectrum of self-reflection tools; on one end you have journaling; on the other, life coaching. ChatGPT is a lot closer to the journaling side of things but with an interactive twist. In fact, it can be useful to think of it as a fancy, interactive form of journaling."
* "🎯Specificity is key: Provide clear details about what you need help with. The more specific you are, the more tailored ChatGPT’s responses will be."
* "🤔 Open-ended questions: Ditch yes-or-no questions and opt for prompts that encourage deeper exploration and reflection."
